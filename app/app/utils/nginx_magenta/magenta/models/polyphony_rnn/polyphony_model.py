    Args:
      num_steps: The integer length in steps of the final track, after
          generation. Includes the primer.
      primer_sequence: The primer sequence, a PolyphonicSequence object.
      temperature: A float specifying how much to divide the logits by
         before computing the softmax. Greater than 1.0 makes tracks more
         random, less than 1.0 makes tracks less random.
      beam_size: An integer, beam size to use when generating tracks via
          beam search.
      branch_factor: An integer, beam search branch factor to use.
      steps_per_iteration: An integer, number of steps to take per beam search
          iteration.
      modify_events_callback: An optional callback for modifying the event list.
          Can be used to inject events rather than having them generated. If not
          None, will be called with 3 arguments after every event: the current
          EventSequenceEncoderDecoder, a list of current EventSequences, and a
          list of current encoded event inputs.

      The generated PolyphonicSequence object (which begins with the provided
      primer track).
