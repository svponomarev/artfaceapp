## Building your Dataset

After [installing Magenta](/README.md), you can build your first MIDI dataset. We do this by creating a directory of MIDI files and converting them into NoteSequences. If you don't have any MIDIs handy, you can use the [Lakh MIDI Dataset](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) or find some [at MidiWorld](http://www.midiworld.com/files/142/).

Warnings may be printed by the MIDI parser if it encounters a malformed MIDI file but these can be safely ignored. MIDI files that cannot be parsed will be skipped.

You can also convert MusicXML files to NoteSequences.
```
INPUT_DIRECTORY=<folder containing MIDI and/or MusicXML files. can have child folders.>

# TFRecord file that will contain NoteSequence protocol buffers.
SEQUENCES_TFRECORD=/tmp/notesequences.tfrecord

convert_dir_to_note_sequences \
  --input_dir=$INPUT_DIRECTORY \
  --output_file=$SEQUENCES_TFRECORD \
  --recursive
```
