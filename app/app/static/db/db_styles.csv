            <p> As photography celebrated its <b>50th anniversary</b> in 1889, new technologies were revolutionizing the medium. While its subjects and social functions were fairly well defined by then, it remained a specialized form of picture-making that still held some of the magical aura of its birth. The average person was familiar with what photographs looked like and probably kept some at home, but few people took photographs themselves. In addition, most photographs existed as unique originals, because copies were still difficult to make.</p>

            <figcaption>Original Kodak Box Camera</figcaption></figure>
            <p> All this soon changed as a result of two important introductions: the simple-to-use <b>Kodak camera</b> and the <b>halftone printing process</b>. American inventor <b>George Eastman</b> perfected his Kodak camera in 1888 and began selling it with the slogan <b>""You push the button, we do the rest.""</b> Eastman's invention put cameras into the hands of millions of people unskilled in the techniques of earlier photography and vastly increased the number of pictures taken each year. The halftone printing process, perfected in the mid-1890s, reproduces photographs as a set of tiny dots of varying diameter. Groupings of larger dots appear as an area of black, while smaller ones recreate various shades of gray. Halftone printing enabled publishers to reproduce photographs easily, economically, and accurately. For the first time, large numbers of photographs were reproduced in newspapers, magazines, and inexpensive books.</p>

            <p> After the introduction of the handheld amateur camera by Kodak, patrician gentlemen with artistic ambitions no longer dominated the medium of photography. As an army of weekend <b>“snapshooters”</b> invaded the photographic realm, a small but persistent group of photographers staked their medium’s claim to membership among the fine arts. They rejected the point-and-shoot approach to photography and embraced labor-intensive processes such as gum bichromate printing, which involved hand-coating artist papers with homemade emulsions and pigments, or they made platinum prints, which yielded rich, tonally subtle images. Such photographs emphasized the role of the photographer as craftsman and countered the argument that photography was an entirely mechanical medium. <b>Alfred Stieglitz</b> was the most prominent spokesperson for these photographers in America, and in 1902 he and several like-minded associates broke away from the club to form what they dubbed the <b>Photo-Secession</b>.</p>

            <p> By the end of World War I, Stieglitz and Steichen were shedding <b>Pictorial photography</b>’s painterly facade in order to promote an unvarnished display of the medium’s natural strength—namely, its capacity for producing a truthful rendering of abstract form and tonal variation in the real world.</p>

            <p>Pictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of World War II. During this period the new style of <b>photographic Modernism</b> came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s. </p>
            <p> Although the Photo-Secession members eventually went their separate ways, all of them were instrumental in establishing photography’s expressive potential and demonstrating that its value lay beyond reproducing the outlines of the world around us. Pictorialist works were as beautifully rendered as any painter’s canvas and as skillfully constructed as any graphic artist’s composition. In manipulating the presentation of information in a photographic negative, the Pictorialists injected their own sensibility into our perception of the image—thereby imbuing it with <b>pictorial meaning</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Cubism</b> was invented around 1907 in Paris by <b>Pablo Picasso</b> and <b>Georges Braque</b>. It was the first abstract style of modern art. Cubist paintings ignore the traditions of perspective drawing and show you many views of a subject at one time. The approach was a radical break and offered a new way of describing space, volume and mass with new pictorial devices. More generally, it pointed new paths towards abstract art, and suggested ways of describing life in the modern urban world.</p>

            <p>The Cubists believed that the traditions of Western art had become exhausted and another remedy they applied to revitalize their work was to draw on the expressive energy of art from other cultures, especially <b>African art</b>. However, they were not interested in the true spiritual or social symbolism of these cultural objects, but valued them superficially for their expressive style. They viewed them as subversive elements that could be used to attack and subsequently refresh the tired tradition of Western art. This inspiration to cross-reference art from different cultures probably came from <b>Paul Gauguin</b>, the French post-impressionist artist, whose paintings and prints were influenced by the native culture of Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands where he spent his final years.</p>
            <p>The artists abandoned perspective, which had been used to depict space since the Renaissance, and they also turned away from the realistic modeling of figures. Cubists explored open form, piercing figures and objects by letting the space flow through them, blending background into foreground, and showing objects from various angles. Some historians have argued that these innovations represent a response to the changing experience of space, movement, and time in the modern world. This first phase of the movement was called <b>Analytic Cubism</b>.</p>
            <p>In the second phase of Cubism, <b>Synthetic Cubists</b> explored the use of non-art materials as abstract signs. Their use of newspaper would lead later historians to argue that, instead of being concerned above all with form, the artists were also acutely aware of current events, particularly WWI. Cubism paved the way for non-representational art by putting new emphasis on the unity between a depicted scene and the surface of the canvas.</p>

            <p> <b>Suprematism</b>, the invention of Russian artist <b>Kazimir Malevich</b>, was one of the earliest and most radical developments in abstract art. Its name derived from Malevich's belief that Suprematist art would be superior to all the art of the past, and that it would lead to the ""<b>supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts</b>."" Heavily influenced by avant-garde poets, and an emerging movement in literary criticism, Malevich derived his interest in flouting the rules of language, in defying reason. He believed that there were only delicate links between words or signs and the objects they denote, and from this he saw the possibilities for a totally abstract art. And just as the poets and literary critics were interested in what constituted literature, Malevich came to be intrigued by the search for art's barest essentials. It was a radical and experimental project that at times came close to a strange mysticism. Although the Communist authorities later attacked the movement, its influence was pervasive in Russia in the early 1920s, and it was important in shaping <b>Constructivism</b>, just as it has been in inspiring abstract art to this day.</p>
            <figure class=""align-right"">

            <p>The Suprematists' interest in abstraction was fired by a search for the <b>'zero degree'</b> of painting, the point beyond which the medium could not go without ceasing to be art. This encouraged the use of very simple motifs, since they best articulated the shape and flat surface of the canvases on which they were painted. (Ultimately, the square, circle, and cross became the group's favorite motifs.) It also encouraged many Suprematists to emphasize <b>the surface texture of the paint on canvas </b>, this texture being another essential quality of the medium of painting. Though much Suprematist art can seem highly austere and serious, there was a strong tone of absurdism running through the movement. One of Malevich's initial inspirations for the movement was <b>zaum</b>, or transrational poetry, of some of his contemporaries, something that led him to the idea of <b>'zaum painting.'</b></p>
            <p> The Russian Formalists, an important and highly influential group of literary critics, who were Malevich's contemporaries, were opposed to the idea that language is a simple, transparent vehicle for communication. They pointed out that words weren't so easily linked to the objects they denoted. This fostered the idea that <b>art could serve to make the world fresh and strange </b>, art could make us look at the world in new ways. Suprematist abstract painting was aimed at doing much the same, by removing the real world entirely and leaving the viewer to contemplate what kind of picture of the world is offered by, for instance, <b>a Black Square</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Expressionism</b> emerged simultaneously in various cities across Germany as a response to a widespread anxiety about humanity's increasingly discordant relationship with the world and accompanying lost feelings of authenticity and spirituality. In part a reaction against Impressionism and academic art, Expressionism was inspired most heavily by the Symbolist currents in late nineteenth-century art. <b>Vincent van Gogh</b>, <b>Edvard Munch</b>, and <b>James Ensor</b> proved particularly influential to the Expressionists, encouraging the distortion of form and the deployment of strong colors to convey <b>a variety of anxieties and yearnings</b>. The classic phase of the Expressionist movement lasted from approximately 1905 to 1920 and spread throughout Europe. Its example would later inform <b>Abstract Expressionism</b>, and its influence would be felt throughout the remainder of the century in German art. It was also a critical precursor to the <b>Neo-Expressionist artists</b> of the 1980s.</p>

            <p>The arrival of Expressionism announced new standards in the creation and judgment of art. Art was now meant to come forth from within the artist, rather than from a depiction of the external visual world, and the standard for assessing the quality of a work of art became <b>the character of the artist's feelings</b> rather than an analysis of the composition.</p>
            <p>Expressionist artists often employed <b>swirling</b>, <b>swaying</b>, and <b>exaggeratedly executed brushstrokes</b> in the depiction of their subjects. These techniques were meant to convey the turgid emotional state of the artist reacting to the anxieties of the modern world.</p>
            <p>They also drew their inspiration from <b>German Gothic</b> and <b>'primitive art'</b>. The Expressionists were divided into two factions: <b>Die Brücke</b> and <b>Der Blaue Reiter</b>. Die Brücke (<b>The Bridge</b>) was an artistic community of young artists in Dresden who aimed to overthrow the conservative traditions of German art. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff were two of its founding members. Der Blaue Reiter (<b>The Blue Rider</b>) was a group of artists whose publications and exhibitions sought to find a common creative ground between the various Expressionist art forms. Kandinsky, Marc and Macke were among its founding members. </p>
            <p>Through their confrontation with the urban world of the early twentieth century, Expressionist artists developed a powerful mode of social criticism in their <b>serpentine figural renderings</b> and <b>bold colors</b>. Their representations of the modern city included alienated individuals - a psychological by-product of recent urbanization - as well as prostitutes, who were used to comment on capitalism's role in the emotional distancing of individuals within cities. </p>

            With the fundamental process of capturing a photographic image overcome, the next challenge for the early picture pioneer was to make photographs more durable. And so the quest to conquer this challenges ensued. <b>Hamilton Smith</b>’s patented process of photo toning put those early picture pioneers back to work experimenting with a variety of different toners. There were a number of successes but it was not until the use of <b>pigment from the ink sac of the common cuttlefish</b> that a great discovery was made. Through chemical conversion, <b>the silver nitrate</b> that was used and was causing the instability in early photographs, was replaced by <b>a sulfide</b> of which the pigment from the cuttlefish is comprised. Not only did this change significantly increase the durability of the photograph but the resulting <b>dark brown tone</b> from the pigment made the photograph far more pleasing to the eye, a result which came quite by accident. Gone now was the cold, dark and eerie feeling formerly captured by the photographer, the same subject matter now seeming more <b>vibrant</b> and <b>alive</b>. This new method, referred to as <b>sepia-toning</b>, became a staple for photograph developing from the 1860’s until the 1920’s. However, by 1930 sepia-toning had all but been replaced by the next generation of photo development technology.

            <p>A distinguishing feature of the photography of the 1920s was the emergence of <b>a wide variety of techniques, styles, and approaches</b>, all displaying unusual vigor. Responding to greater economic opportunities in the medium and involved in the intense intellectual, political, and cultural ferment that followed the first World War, many photographers became conscious of the effects of technology, urbanization, cinema, and graphic art on camera expression. In addition to the ""isms"" of prewar avant-garde art—especially <b>Cubism</b> — the aesthetic concepts associated with <b>Constructivism</b>, <b>Dadaism</b>, and <b>Surrealism</b> inspired <b>a climate of experimentation</b>, with <i>photo-collage</i>, <i>montage</i>, <i>cameraless images</i>, <i>nonobjective forms</i>, <i>unusual angles</i>, and <i>extreme close-ups</i> marking the photographic expression of the era. In common with other visual artists, photographers also took note of Freudian and related theories of the psyche and of the part that images might play in the social and political struggles of the times. </p>

            <p><b>The Decade's Cameras</b>. The 1920s saw metal become an important medium in the construction of cameras. Nickel, chrome and aluminum were used to create parts, plating and castings. Kodak created many widely used photographic equipment, including the <b>No.1 Pocket Junior</b> and <b>No.1 Autographic</b>. The Houghton Speed Reflex was an early example of a single lens reflex camera, which allows the photographer to view an image as it will appear on film before the shot is taken. </p>
            <p><b>Famous Photographers</b>. Many photographers whom we consider legendary today produced quality work in the '20s. 1920 saw <b>Ansel Adams</b> enjoy his first published photograph in the ""Sierra Club Bulletin."" Pennsylvania-born <b>Man Ray</b> moved to Paris in the 1920s and there began the creation of ""Rayographs,"" uniquely styled silhouette photographs called photograms. Fashion photographer <b>Edward Steichen</b> experienced great success during the era as the chief photographer for ""Vogue"" and ""Vanity Fair."" George Hoyningen-Huene also ranked among the decade's great shutterbugs. </p>
            <p><b>1920s Photographic Style</b>. Photography of the '20s was characterized by passionate experimentation with an array of artistic styles and concepts. Psychic theories espoused by Freud and others also influenced photographers to engage with the medium's capacity to communicate societally and intellectually. <b>Photojournalism</b>'s importance to coverage of WWI also increased the journalistic and monetary presence of the art form in the 1920s.</p>
            <p><b>Notable Photos</b>. <b>""Le Violon d'Ingres,""</b> taken by Man Ray in 1924, ranks among the most famous photographs ever. F-holes on the model's back made her a metaphor for a violin; some consider the photo a presage of contemporary digital photography. Edward Steichen took a famous candid photo of comic luminary <b>Charlie Chaplin</b> in 1925. Clarence Sinclair Bull, the illustrious photographer of celebrities, began his famous portraiture collaboration with <b>Greta Garbo</b> in 1929.</p>

            <p><b>The Art Deco </b> style manifested across the spectrum of the visual arts: from architecture, painting, and sculpture to the graphic and decorative arts. While Art Deco practitioners were often paying homage to modernist influences such as <b>Cubism</b>, <b>De Stijl</b>, and <b>Futurism</b>, the references were indirect; it was as though they were taking the end results of a few decades of distilling compositions to <b>the most basic forms</b> and inventing a new style that could be <b>visually pleasing but not intellectually threatening</b>. The Art Deco style originated in Paris, but has influenced architecture and culture as a whole. Art Deco works are <i>symmetrical</i>, <i>geometric</i>, <i>streamlined</i>, often <i>simple</i>, and <i>pleasing to the eye</i>. This style is in contrast to avant-garde art of the period, which challenged everyday viewers to find meaning and beauty in what were often unapologetically anti-traditional images and forms.</p>

            <p>Art Deco, similar to <b>Art Nouveau</b>, is a modern art style that attempts to infuse functional objects with artistic touches. This movement is different from the fine arts (painting and sculpture) where the art object has no practical purpose or use beyond providing interesting viewing.</p>
            <p>With the advent of large-scale manufacturing, artists and designers wished to <b>enhance the appearance of mass-produced functional objects</b> - everything from clocks and ashtrays to cars and buildings. Art Deco's pursuit of <b>beauty in all aspects of life</b> was directly reflective of the relative newness and mass usage of machine-age technology rather than traditional crafting methods to produce many objects. The Bauhaus school was also interested in industrial production, but in a sense The Bauhaus is the polar opposite as it refrained from artistic embellishments - preferring <b>clean and simple geometric forms</b>.</p>
            <p>The Art Deco ethos diverged from the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts styles, which emphasized the uniqueness and originality of handmade objects and featured stylized, organic forms. That crafted quality was emblematic of a kind of elitism in opposition to Art Deco's more egalitarian aim: to make <b>aesthetically appealing, machine-made objects</b> that were available to everyone.</p>
            <p><b>Streamline Moderne</b>, the American version of the Art Deco style was a stripped-down and sleek version of the more elaborate and often bespoke <b>European Art Deco style</b>. In many ways, the American style grew and evolved to have a much bigger following and use in the U.S. than in Europe. </p>

            <p><b>Constructivism</b> was the last and most influential modern art movement to flourish in Russia in the 20th century. It evolved just as the Bolsheviks came to power in the October Revolution of 1917, and initially it acted as a lightning rod for the hopes and ideas of many of the most advanced Russian artists who supported the revolution's goals. It borrowed ideas from <b>Cubism</b>, <b>Suprematism</b> and <b>Futurism</b>, but at its heart was an entirely new approach to making objects, one which sought to abolish the traditional artistic concern with <b>composition</b>, and replace it with <b>'construction.'</b></p>
            <p>Constructivism called for a careful <b>technical analysis of modern materials</b>, and it was hoped that this investigation would eventually yield ideas that could be put to use in <b>mass production</b>, serving the ends of a modern, Communist society. Ultimately, however, the movement floundered in trying to make the <b>transition from the artist's studio to the factory</b>. Some continued to insist on the value of <b>abstract, analytical work</b>, and the value of art per se; these artists had a major impact on spreading Constructivism throughout Europe. Others, meanwhile, pushed on to a new but short-lived and disappointing phase known as <b>Productivism</b>, in which artists worked in industry. Russian Constructivism was in decline <b>by the mid 1920s</b>, partly a victim of the Bolshevik regime's increasing hostility to <b>avant-garde art</b>. But it would continue to be an inspiration for artists in the West, sustaining a movement called <b>International Constructivism</b> which flourished in Germany in the 1920s, and whose legacy endured into the 1950s.</p>

            <p>Constructivists proposed to replace art's traditional concern with composition with <b>a focus on construction</b>. Objects were to be created not in order to express beauty, or the artist's outlook, or to represent the world, but to carry out a fundamental analysis of the materials and forms of art, one which might lead to the <b>design of functional objects</b>. For many Constructivists, this entailed an <b>ethic of ""truth to materials,""</b> the belief that materials should be employed only in accordance with their capacities, and in such a way that demonstrated the uses to which they could be put. </p>
            <p>Constructivist art often aimed to demonstrate how materials behaved - to ask, for instance, what <b>different properties</b> had materials such as wood, glass, and metal. <b>The form an artwork would take would be dictated by its materials </b> (not the other way around, as is the case in traditional art forms, in which the artist 'transforms' base materials into something very different and beautiful). For some, these inquiries were a means to an end, the goal being the translation of ideas and designs into mass production; for others it was an end in itself, a new and archetypal modern style expressing <b>the dynamism of modern life</b>. </p>
            <p>The seed of Constructivism was a desire to express the experience of modern life - <b>its dynamism, its new and disorientating qualities of space and time</b>. But also crucial was the desire to develop a new form of art more appropriate to the democratic and modernizing goals of the Russian Revolution. Constructivists were to be <b>constructors of a new society</b> - cultural workers on par with scientists in their search for solutions to modern problems.

            <p>Photographically, <b>lighting styles</b> were evolving into the greatest burst of visual elegance to date. Movies had become the “great escape” for people, and audiences in the ’30s saw movie stars as even more “larger than life” than they did in the ’20s. MGM’s tag line, <b>“More stars than there are in heaven”</b> was never more valid, as actors became the elite royalty of the country. Two great photographers that fully emerged during this decade, <b>Clarence Sinclair Bull</b> and <b>George Hurrell</b>, were hired to photograph both the biggest and smallest names in Hollywood. Two classic looks were achieved with <b>three lights with grids</b>, precise positioning of the main light to establish the contrast and specularity of the light, and <b>serious overexposure from the kickers</b>.</p>

            <p> Although it began to emerge in the tate 19th century, the <b>documentary mode</b> was not clearly defined as such until the <b>1930s</b>, when American photography historian Beaumont Newhall noted that while the social documentary photographer is neither a mere recorder nor an ""artist for arts sake, his reports are often <b>brilliant technically and highly artistic</b>"" — that is, documentary images involve imagination and art in that they <b>imbue fact with feeling</b>. With their focus mainly on <b>people and social conditions</b>, images in the documentary style combine <b>lucid pictorial organization</b> with an often <b>passionate commitment to humanistic values</b> — to ideals of dignity, the right to decent conditions of living and work, to truthfulness. Lewis Hine, one of the early partisans of social documentation, explained its goals when he declared that light was required to <b>illuminate the dark areas of social existence</b>, but where to shine the light and how to frame the subject in the camera are the creative decisions that have become the measure of the effective-ness of this style to both inform and move the viewer. </p>

            <p><b>Social realism</b>, also known as <b>socio-realism</b>, became an important art movement during <b>the Great Depression</b> in the 1930s. Social realism depicted social and racial injustice, and economic hardship through <b>unvarnished pictures of life’s struggles</b>, and often portrayed working-class activities as heroic. The movement was largely a style of painting that typically conveyed a message of social or political protest edged with satire; however, it also extended to the art of photography. Prominent photographers at the time included <b>Walker Evans</b>, <b>Dorothea Lange</b>, Margaret Bourke-White>, Lewis Hine, Edward Steichen, <b>Gordon Parks</b>, Arthur Rothstein, Marion Post Wolcott, Doris Ulmann, Berenice Abbott, Aaron Siskind, and Russell Lee, among several others. Each of these artists sought to depict the world–and often the poverty–they saw around them with the realistic portrayal that only photography could provide.</p>
            <p><b>The Farm Security Administration</b>, part of the New Deal, was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty. The majority of the program was directed towards rural rehabilitation, but it is also known for funding the work of a number of photographers. From 1935–1944, the Farm Security Administration employed several photographers to <b>document the effects of the Great Depression on the population of America</b>. The Information Division of the FSA was responsible for providing educational materials and press information to the public. Under Roy Stryker, the Information Division of the FSA adopted a goal of <b>""introducing America to Americans.""</b> Many of the most famous Depression-era photographers were fostered by the FSA project.</p>

            <p>Alongside social realism, another approach to photography, referred to as <b>straight photography</b>, was also gaining momentum. <b>Group f/64</b> is perhaps the most well-known example of this art movement. Group f/64 was a group of seven, 20th-century San Francisco photographers who shared a common photographic style characterized by <b>sharp-focused and carefully framed images</b> seen through a particularly Western viewpoint. In part, they formed in opposition to the pictorialism movement in photography that had dominated much of the early 20th century, but moreover they wanted to promote a new modernist aesthetic that was based on <b>precisely exposed images of natural forms and found objects </b>. Photographers involved in the group included Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, John Paul Edwards, Sonya Noskowiak, Henry Swift, Willard Van Dyke, and Edward Weston.</p>

            <p><b>Surrealism</b> was the 20th century art movement that explored <b>the hidden depths of the 'unconscious mind'</b>. The Surrealists rejected the rational world as 'it only allows for the consideration of those facts relevant to our experience'. They sought a new kind of reality, a heightened reality that they called <b>'surreality'</b>, which was found in the world of images drawn from <b>their dreams and imagination</b>. Surrealism was founded in Paris where many of the Dadaists had settled after the Great War. It was originally a literary movement but its unusual imagery was more suited to the visual arts and to those artists who were searching for a more consistent approach to art as an antidote to the chaos of <b>Dada</b>. Surrealism was similar in character to <b>Dadaism</b> as both were <b>hostile to the traditions of academic art</b> and the values that it stood for. The main difference between the two movements was in their method of opposition. While the Dadaists were content to blast the establishment with a scattergun of negativity, the Surrealists were in search of a more creative and positive philosophy.</p>

            <p> The Surrealists sought to <b>channel the unconscious</b> as a means to unlock the power of the imagination. Disdaining rationalism and literary realism, and powerfully <b>influenced by psychoanalysis</b>, the Surrealists believed the rational mind repressed the power of the imagination, weighting it down with taboos. Influenced also by <b>Karl Marx</b>, they hoped that the psyche had the power to reveal the contradictions in the everyday world and spur on revolution. Their emphasis on the power of personal imagination puts them in the tradition of <b>Romanticism</b>, but unlike their forebears, they believed that revelations could be found on the street and in everyday life. The Surrealist impulse to tap the unconscious mind, and their interests in <b>myth and primitivism</b>, went on to shape many later movements, and the style remains influential to this today. Over the years there have been many artists associated with Surrealism which continues to exert its influence on art to this day. However, those major figures who were responsible for creating the golden age of Surrealism were <b>Joan Miro</b>, <b>Max Ernst</b>, <b>Salvador Dali</b> and <b>René Magritte</b>. </p>

            <p><b>André Breton</b> defined Surrealism as ""<b>psychic automatism</b> in its pure state, by which one proposes to express - verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner - the actual functioning of thought."" What Breton is proposing is that artists bypass reason and rationality by accessing their unconscious mind. In practice, these techniques became known as automatism or <b>automatic writing</b>, which allowed artists to forgo conscious thought and embrace chance when creating art. </p>
            <p>The work of <b>Sigmund Freud</b> was profoundly influential for Surrealists, particularly his book, <b>The Interpretation of Dreams (1899)</b>. Freud legitimized the importance of dreams and the unconscious as valid revelations of human emotion and desires; his exposure of the complex and repressed inner worlds of <b>sexuality, desire, and violence</b> provided a theoretical basis for much of Surrealism.</p>

            <p>Surrealist imagery is probably the most recognizable element of the movement, yet it is also the most elusive to categorize and define. <b>Each artist relied on their own recurring motifs</b> arisen through their dreams or/and unconscious mind. At its basic, the imagery is <b>outlandish, perplexing, and even uncanny</b>, as it is meant to <b>jolt the viewer out of their comforting assumptions</b>. Nature, however, is the most frequent imagery: Max Ernst was obsessed with birds and had a bird alter ego, Salvador Dalí's works often include ants or eggs, and Joan Miró relied strongly on vague biomorphic imagery.</p>

            <p><b>Film noir</b> is a cinematic term used primarily to describe <b>stylish Hollywood crime dramas</b>, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivation. Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with <b>a low-key black-and-white visual style</b> that has roots in <b>German Expressionist cinematography</b>, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of <b>crime fiction</b> that emerged in the United States during the Depression. The term <b>film noir</b> (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most American film industry professionals of the era. Cinema historians and critics defined the canon of film noir in retrospect; many of those involved in the making of the classic noirs later professed to be unaware of having created a distinctive type of film.</p>

            <p> Film noirs tended to use low-key lighting schemes producing <b>stark light/dark contrasts</b> and <b>dramatic shadow patterning</b>. The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in film noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness — a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood moviemaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, color films are regarded as noir by varying numbers of critics. Film noir is also known for its use of <b>Dutch angles, low-angle shots, and wide-angle lenses</b>. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Beginning in the late 1940s, location shooting—often involving night-for-night sequences—became increasingly frequent in noir. </p>

            <p> These movies were mostly low-budget productions shot on location in city streets, with an abundance of night scenes, where crime is the main plot. <b>Low-key lighting</b> is the common thread of Film Noir, with harsh light that create <b>deep shadows, resulting in a high contrast black and white</b>. In film noir, the shadows are like characters in the story. It's important for those shadows to be sharp and distinct. This helps the viewer create a clear mental image of the object casting the shadow, like a gloved hand holding a knife or gun from somewhere outside the frame. </p>

            <p>""A photograph is not merely a substitute for a glance. It is a <b>sharpened vision</b>. It is the revelation of new and important facts."" This sentiment, expressed by the Photo League photographer Sid Grossman, encapsulates photography’s role in America in the 1940s and ’50s. The era saw <b>the apotheosis of photojournalism</b> and few photographers were unaffected by its rise, whether they joined the bandwagon or reacted against it.</p>
            <p>Ushering the age of the image into American culture was Margaret Bourke-White’s Fort Peck Dam, Montana, which appeared on the cover of the first issue of Life magazine in November 1936. For the next three decades, magazines (Life foremost among them) told <b>the world’s news stories through pictures</b>. <b>World War II was the first major widespread conflict covered extensively by photojournalists</b>, who earned reputations as heroes for risking their lives to visualize the events. <b>W. Eugene Smith</b> was perhaps the most famous postwar photographer to earn his stripes on the battlefield, and, after the war, his photo essays—a form that he perfected in stories such as “Country Doctor” (1948), “Spanish Village” (1951), and “A Man of Mercy” (on Albert Schweitzer, 1954) — were as unrelenting as his war photographs, <b>making the viewer experience the world as the subjects did and demanding a sympathetic response</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract Expressionism</b> was the first American art style to exert an influence on a global scale. It drew upon the ‘spiritual’ approach of <b>Kandinsky</b>, the 'automatism' of the <b>Surrealists</b>, and a range of dramatic painting techniques. Abstract Expressionism was also known as <b>‘Action Painting’</b>, a title which implied that the <b>physical act of painting</b> was as important as the result itself. The Abstract Expressionist movement embraced paintings from a wide range of artists whose work was not always purely abstract or truly expressionistic. The ‘all-over’ drip paintings of <b>Jackson Pollock</b>, which entangle the viewer in a skein of light, color and texture, were the biggest challenge to the interpretation of pictorial space since <b>Cubism</b>. The paintings of <b>Mark Rothko</b> bathe the spectator in a mystical world of diffuse color while the art of <b>Robert Motherwell</b> sets up an abstract dialogue between his 'automatic' calligraphy and the conscious control of shapes and colors. <b>Willem de Kooning</b>, <b>Franz Kline</b>, <b>Barnet Newman</b> and <b>Clifford Still</b> were other major figures associated with the movement.</p>

            <p> Political instability in Europe <b>in the 1930s</b> brought several leading Surrealists to New York, and many of the Abstract Expressionists were profoundly influenced by Surrealism's focus on <b>mining the unconscious</b>. It encouraged their interest in myth and archetypal symbols and it shaped their understanding of painting itself as <b>a struggle between self-expression and the chaos of the subconscious</b>.</p>
            <p> Most of the artists associated with Abstract Expressionism matured in the 1930s. They were influenced by the era's leftist politics, and came to value an art grounded in personal experience. Few would maintain their earlier radical political views, but many continued to adopt the posture of outspoken avant-gardists. Having matured as artists at a time when America suffered economically and felt culturally isolated and provincial, the Abstract Expressionists were later welcomed as <b>the first authentically American avant-garde</b>. Their art was championed for being emphatically American in spirit - <b>monumental in scale, romantic in mood, and expressive of a rugged individual freedom</b>.</p>

            <p>When you look at your family slides from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, they have a particular look, with <b>rich, deep colors and sharp, clean details</b>. But the colors had subtlety, looking bright and vivid without being garish. It’s an instantly recognizable look that comes from the film that was used to shoot the images: <b>Kodak Kodachrome</b>.</p>
            <p> Kodachrome was developed by two scientists working in the Kodak research lab early in the 20th century. <b>Leopold Godowsky Jr.</b> and <b>Leopold Mannes</b> saw a color movie produced by the US Navy in 1916, and were not impressed with the color rendition. They decided to produce a film chemistry that would produce more accurate color, and the result was Kodachrome, which was first sold <b>in 1917</b>.</p>

            <p> Over time, Kodak improved the film and lowered the cost, and it was used to record significant events. <b>The aftermath of the Hindenburg disaster in 1937</b> was captured by Gerry Sheedy (a staff photographer for the New York Mirror newspaper) using a compact camera with Kodachrome film, as shown in this spread from the Sunday Mirror Magazine from 1937. These are the <b>only color photos of the disaster</b>: other photos were shot on black and white film and colorized afterwards. </p>
            <p>Kodachome was used extensively <b>through the Great Depression, World War II and the 1950s</b>, although the slow speed of the film (an ISO rating of 12) meant that it was mostly restricted to posed shots taken in good light. Hollywood loved the rich colors, and Kodachrome was extensively used in publicity shots for starts like <b>Marilyn Monroe</b>. Kodachrome became a mainstream film in the early 1960s, when Kodak refined the development process to make it cheaper (called the <b>K12 process</b>). They also launched a revised version called <b>Kodachome II</b> that was faster, with the 35mm film version for consumer cameras, boosting the ISO to 25. That was still much slower than other films, but the home photographers of the 1960s couldn’t get enough of the vivid colors and sharp detail of this film for their holiday photos.</p>

            <p>The reason for this vivid color was the different approach of the film chemistry. Color films are made from <b>multiple layers of black and white film</b> that are sensitive to different colors of light. Each layer includes a chemical called <b>a dye coupler</b>. When the film is processed, the dye that represents that color is chemically attached to this dye coupler, creating the final color image. Kodachrome is different, because <b>the dye coupler is not added until the film is developed</b>. This makes the film thinner (so you get <b>better detail</b>) and the dark areas of the image much deeper, producing the <b>high contrast and vivid color</b> that is the trademark of the film. Because the dye coupler is added during processing, it also makes the processing much more complicated, which is why <b>Kodak was the only company that did it</b>. </p>

            <p>Kodachrome continued to be popular through the 1960s and 1970s <b>as a slide film</b>. When combined with a cheap slide projector, it was the basis of one of the great american family rituals of the last century: <b>the holiday photo slide show</b>, a tradition gently mocked by comedians like Charles Phoenix. The popularity of Kodachrome started to ebb in the 1980s, as new films with simpler processing (such as <b>Fujichrome Velvia</b>) became available, and the rise of the one-hour photo lab made slides less popular. Kodachrome remained popular for professional shooters and serious amateurs, though, until it was swept away in that great sea change for photography: <b>digital</b>. </p>

            <p>Artists have been intrigued by the nature of perception and by <b>optical effects and illusions</b> for many centuries. They have often been a central concern of art, just as much as themes drawn from history or literature. But in the 1950s these preoccupations, allied to new interests in technology and psychology, blossomed into a movement. <b>Op, or Optical, art</b> typically employs <b>abstract patterns composed with a stark contrast of foreground and background</b> - often in black and white for maximum contrast - to produce effects that <b>confuse and excite the eye</b>.</p>

            <p> Initially, Op shared the field with <b>Kinetic art</b> - Op artists being drawn to <b>virtual movement</b>, Kinetic artists attracted by the possibility of <b>real motion</b>. Both styles were launched with <b>Le Mouvement</b>, a group exhibition at Galerie Denise Rene <b>in 1955</b>. It attracted a wide international following, and after it was celebrated with a survey exhibition in 1965, <b>The Responsive Eye</b>, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, it caught the public's imagination and led to a craze for Op designs in fashion and the media. To many, it seemed the perfect style for an age defined by the onward march of science, by advances in computing, aerospace, and television. But art critics were never so supportive of it, attacking its effects as gimmicks, and today it remains tainted by those dismissals.</p>
            <p>Although Op can be seen as the successor to <b>geometric abstraction</b>, its stress on illusion and perception suggests that it might also have older ancestors. It may descend from effects that were once popular with Old Masters, such as <b>trompe l'oeil (French: ""deceive the eye"")</b>. Or indeed from <b>anamorphosis</b>, the effect by which images are contorted so that objects are only fully recognizable when viewed from an oblique angle.</p>

            <p>Op Artists such as <b>Victor Vasarely</b>, <b>Bridget Riley</b> and <b>Richard Anuszkiewicz</b> play with the perception of the viewer by subverting the picture plane with <b>ambiguous shapes, shifting tones and dynamic color relationships</b>. Although Op Art images are static they generate the illusion of movement with perceptual tricks that create <b>an unstable picture surface</b>. The effects of this can be so strong that you have to look away for fear of losing your balance or hurting your eyes. Needless to say that the fairground fun aspect of Op Art was very popular with the public and was quickly commercialized by the design and fashion industries. 
            </p>
            <p>During its years of greatest success in the mid-1960s, the movement was sometimes said to encompass a wide range of artists whose interests in abstraction had little to do with perception. Some, such as <b>Joseph Albers</b>, who were often labeled as Op artists, dismissed it. Yet the fact that the label could seem to apply to so many artists demonstrates <b>how important the nuances of vision have been throughout modern art</b>. </p>
            <p>Long after Op art's demise, its reputation continues to hang in the balance. Some critics continue to characterize its designs as <b>""retinal titillations.""</b> But others have recently argued that the style represented <b>a kind of abstract Pop art</b>, one which emulated the dazzle of consumer society but which refused, unlike Pop artists like Andy Warhol, to celebrate its icons.</p>

            <p>With the possible exception of the keyhole, there is no frame for an image more familiar than the white border of a <b>Polaroid instant photograph</b>. Anchored by a thick strip that acts as a plinth for the picture above, a Polaroid imbues even the hastiest snapshots with a certain artistic flair. Scientist and inventor <b>Edwin Land</b> was on holiday when he decided to snap a photograph of his three-year-old daughter. Land’s daughter asked why she couldn’t <b>see the photo right away</b>. Having a loss of words for the reason, Land set out to create a system that could accomplish the task. <b>In 1948</b>, the <b>Polaroid Land Model 95 camera</b> was born — a phenomenon was about to hit the world. </p>
            <figure class=""align-left"">
            <img alt=""The original Land Model 95"" src=""app/static/images/info/photo_1960_1.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"" />
            <figcaption>The original Land Model 95</figcaption></figure>
            <p> Edwin Land's original idea behind instant photography was to create a photographic system that was <b>seamless</b> and <b>easy for anyone to use</b>. If you have ever held an instant photograph, you can feel a <b>bump at the top of the image border</b>. This bump is <b>a collection of the used chemical</b> after it has been spread across the film by the camera’s internal rollers. <b>The collection of compounds</b>, initially held separately in the thick lower portion of the film, is <b>squeegeed vertically across the picture</b>. When the reagent layer is pushed across the film, the light blockers protect any additional photons from hitting the color sensitive layers. Other chemicals in the reagent layer then <b>move downward through the layers to develop the image</b>. The image layer showcases the final result of the photograph as the unexposed areas of the color layers are diffused upwards. </p>
<p> The remaining two layers on top of the picture layer are also working hard while the photo itself is developing. The acid layer reacts with the reagent layer to dissolve the opacifiers that previously protect the film from additional exposure. A timing layer that sits between the acid layer prevents the acid from working too quickly. This magical process of chemical reactions <b>occur in only a few minutes</b>, and before you know it, the fully developed photograph is fully exposed and protected by a piece of clear top plastic. A common misnomer is that when you watch the image turn from ghostly white into a full blown image, you are watching <b>the photograph develop</b>. In fact, the picture has already been developed and you are actually watching the film’s acid layer remove the white opacifiers.</p>
            <p>Beginning <b>in the late 1940s</b>, the Polaroid Corporation would change the face of contemporary photography, both for everyday consumers and for artists. While instant cameras were originally marketed to families and amateur shutterbugs, the company was also successful in engaging fine artists via their Artist Support Program, which offered creatives like <b>Robert Rauschenberg</b> and <b>Andy Warhol</b> free film and studio time. Those collaborations would lead to decades of fruitful uses (and often misuses) of the developing technology. </p>
            <p>Initial Polaroid film produced only <b>sepia-toned prints</b>, followed by <b>black-and-white in 1950</b>, and <b>color images in 1963</b>. Some models produced reusable negatives, allowing for multiples or editions, while others created <b>unique one-off prints</b>. For contemporary artists, it was often the latter option that proved the most interesting. </p>

            <p>What exactly has made Polaroid so tempting for artists? William Ewing, director of curatorial projects for Thames & Hudson, points to various factors. ""First, instantaneity—which meant <b>evaluation and revision immediately</b>, rather than sending stuff to a lab and forgetting about it for a while,"" he says. ""Also, <b>the colors</b>; everyone speaks of the ‘only Polaroid can do this’ quality."" ""I think artists also felt they were on <b>a technological cutting-edge</b>,"" he adds. At the same time, Polaroid technology harkened back to early photographic processes before film — like <b>daguerreotypes</b> or <b>tintypes</b> — that created unique objects, says Erin Barnett, the director of exhibitions and collections at the International Center of Photography. ""Once it became an infinitely reproducible medium, photography moved even farther away from 'fine art,'"" she explains. ""I imagine that artists liked the idea of creating <b>a singular, non-reproducible object</b>.""</p>
            <p>But why do people still want Polaroid photographs in an age when digital-camera filters and photo apps can exactly mimic Polaroid’s aesthetic?  It is not so much a nostalgic preference as <b>a tactile, corporeal one</b>, ""because you are part of the process of the photo becoming an image, the whole thing becomes more valuable."" While many were afraid digital would kill analog technologies, explains Florian Kaps, The Impossible Project’s Austrian founder, ""<b>digital actually created a demand for the physical</b>."" As one of Polaroid’s old advertising jingles once sang, ""<b>It’s more than a camera, it’s almost alive.</b>""</p>

            <p><b>Pop Art</b> was the art movement that characterized a sense of optimism during <b>the post war consumer boom of the 1950's and 60's</b>. It coincided with the globalization of pop music and youth culture, personified by <b>Elvis</b> and <b>The Beatles</b>. Pop Art was <b>brash</b>, <b>colorful</b>, <b>young</b>, <b>fun</b> and <b>hostile to the artistic establishment</b>. It included different styles of painting and sculpture from various countries, but what they all had in common was an interest in popular culture.</p>
            <figure class=""align-left"">

            <figcaption>A. Warhol, Campbell's Soup 1 (Tomato), 1968</figcaption></figure>
            <p> Pop art started with the New York artists <b>Andy Warhol</b>, <b>Roy Lichtenstein</b>, <b>James Rosenquist</b>, and <b>Claes Oldenburg</b>, all of whom drew on popular imagery and were actually part of an international phenomenon. Following the popularity of the <b>Abstract Expressionists</b>, Pop's reintroduction of identifiable imagery (drawn from mass media and popular culture) was a major shift for the direction of modernism. The subject matter became far from traditional ""high art"" themes of morality, mythology, and classic history; rather, Pop artists celebrated <b>commonplace objects and people of everyday life</b>, in this way seeking to <b>elevate popular culture to the level of fine art</b>. Perhaps owing to the incorporation of commercial images, Pop art has become one of the most recognizable styles of modern art.</p>
<p> By creating paintings or sculptures of mass culture objects and media stars, the Pop art movement aimed to blur the boundaries between ""high"" art and ""low"" culture. The concept that <b>there is no hierarchy of culture</b> and that art may borrow from any source has been one of the most influential characteristics of Pop art. </p>
            <p>It could be argued that the Abstract Expressionists searched for trauma in the soul, while Pop artists searched for traces of the same <b>trauma in the mediated world</b> of advertising, cartoons, and popular imagery at large. But it is perhaps more precise to say that Pop artists were the first to recognize that there is no unmediated access to anything, be it the soul, the natural world, or the built environment. Pop artists believed <b>everything is inter-connected</b>, and therefore sought to make those connections literal in their artwork.</p>
            <p>Although Pop art encompasses a wide variety of work with very different attitudes and postures, much of it is somewhat <b>emotionally removed</b>. In contrast to the ""hot"" expression of the gestural abstraction that preceded it, Pop art is <b>generally ""coolly"" ambivalent</b>. Whether this suggests an acceptance of the popular world or a shocked withdrawal, has been the subject of much debate </p>

            <p>Pop artists seemingly embraced the post-WWII manufacturing and media boom. Some critics have cited the Pop art choice of imagery as <b>an enthusiastic endorsement of the capitalist market</b> and the goods it circulated, while others have noted an element of <b>cultural critique</b> in the Pop artists' elevation of the everyday to high art: tying the commodity status of the goods represented to the status of the art object itself, emphasizing art's place as, at base, a commodity.</p>
            <p>The majority of Pop artists began their careers in commercial art: <b>Andy Warhol</b> was a highly successful magazine illustrator and graphic designer; <b>Ed Ruscha</b> was also a graphic designer, and <b>James Rosenquist</b> started his career as a billboard painter. Their background in the commercial art world trained them in the visual vocabulary of mass culture as well as the techniques to seamlessly merge the realms of high art and popular culture.</p>
<p>The stark look of Pop Art emerged from a fusion of <b>Dada collages</b> and 'readymades' with the imagery of the consumer culture. It was seen as an antidote to the introspection of <b>Abstract Expressionism</b>. The expressive techniques of <b>Jasper Johns</b> and <b>Robert Rauschenberg</b> provided the stylistic link between Abstract Expressionism and Pop but the images of celebrity and consumerism by <b>Andy Warhol</b> and the comic book iconography of <b>Roy Lichtenstein</b> represent the style as we know it today.</p>

            <p>Continuing the example set by <b>Diane Arbus</b>, a gritty sort of <b>social documentation</b> emerged beginning in the 1970s and ’80s, when photographers such as <b>Larry Clark</b> and <b>Nan Goldin</b> documented <b>alternative lifestyles</b> involving drug addiction, transvestism, and casual sex. In particular, Goldin created an elaborate series titled <b>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</b>, through which she compiled an evolving record of the people she and her camera encountered. Such direct, unflinching photographs established <b>intimate documentary work</b> as an important genre in the late 20th century. Photographers such as <b>Sally Mann</b> and <b>Tina Barney</b> extended this genre to portray <b>intimate, sometimes unsettling images</b> of their own families. </p>
<p> Goldin usually photographed in colour, which added to <b>the harsh sense of reality</b> in their work; this represented <b>a general move toward colour</b> among photographers of their generation. <b>William Eggleston</b> pushed the artistic boundaries of colour by using it to explore <b>the banality of small-town existence</b>; along these same lines, <b>Candida Höfer</b> used colour to emphasize <b>the tedium of institutional life</b>. <b>Richard Misrach</b> created a massive project, known as <b>the Desert Cantos</b>, in which he photographed desert scenes in colour, sometimes juxtaposed against sinister elements such as nuclear sites. <b>Barbara Norfleet</b>, <b>Joel Meyerowitz</b>, <b>Stephen Shore</b>, <b>Barbara Kasten</b>, and <b>Franco Fontana</b> were among the other prominent photographers of the period who used colour expressively in landscapes, interiors, still lifes, and street scenes.</p>

            <p> For over hundreds of years photography was rejected by the world of fine arts. It was only <b>in the 1970's</b> when <b>conceptual art began to use photography as a primary mode of expression</b> that photography finally took center stage. <b>Conceptual photography</b> moved uninterruptedly from the late 1970's into the <b>postmodern appropriation movement</b> that dominated the international art scene in the 1980's. <b>By the early 1980's</b>, photography had become a fixture in museums, academia, and the art world at large. </p>
<p>During the 1970', as some photographers strayed from the traditional ways of photography, they began to <b>experiment with new forms</b>. Shaped by the repercussions of the <b>Vietnam war</b> and other conflicts, some photographers took the medium <b>in a political direction</b>. Many followed this photography style of social documentation and conceptual photography as they aimed to portray <b>personal observations of aspects of American society</b>. Photo's exerted influence on both subject matter and style as photography as an art form. Photographers tried to capture <b>humour, sadness and irony in daily life</b>.</p>
<p> <b>New York's museum of modern arts 1976 exhibition</b> was a turning point in which colour photographers were accepted as fine art. Art school's and universities introduced photography courses and classes grew.</p>

            <p><b>Minimalism</b> emerged in New York in the early 1960s among artists who were self-consciously renouncing recent art they thought had become stale and academic. A wave of new influences and rediscovered styles led younger artists to question conventional boundaries between various media. The new art favored <b>the cool over the ""dramatic""</b>: their sculptures were frequently <b>fabricated from industrial materials and emphasized anonymity</b> over the expressive excess of <b>Abstract Expressionism</b>. Painters and sculptors avoided overt symbolism and emotional content, but instead called <b>attention to the materiality of the works</b>. By the end of <b>the 1970s</b>, Minimalism had triumphed in America and Europe through a combination of forces including museum curators, art dealers, and publications, plus new systems of private and government patronage.</p>

            <figcaption><b>Style transfer painting</b>: M. Barre, 76-77-C, 1977</figcaption></figure>
            <p> Minimalist art used <b>hard-edged forms and geometric grid structures</b>. Color was simply used to define <b>space or surface</b>. <b>Ad Reinhardt</b>, whose late paintings anticipate Minimalism, put it simply, ‘The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. <b>More is less. Less is more.</b> The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.’</p>
<p>Minimalists distanced themselves from the Abstract Expressionists by removing suggestions of biography from their art or, indeed, metaphors of any kind. This <b>denial of expression</b> coupled with an interest in making objects that avoided the appearance of fine art led to the creation of <b>sleek, geometric works that purposefully and radically eschew conventional aesthetic appeal</b>.</p>
<p> The post-Sputnik era revived active interest in <b>Russian Constructivism</b>. The Constructivist approach led to the use of <b>modular fabrication and industrial materials</b> in preference to the craft techniques of traditional sculpture. <b>The readymades of Marcel Duchamp</b> were also inspirational examples of the employment of prefabricated materials. Based on these sources, Minimalists created works that <b>resembled factory-built commodities</b> and upended traditional definitions of art whose meaning was tied to a narrative or to the artist.</p>

            <p>The use of prefabricated industrial materials and <b>simple, often repeated geometric forms</b> together with the emphasis placed on the <b>physical space occupied by the artwork</b> led to some works that forced the viewer to confront the arrangement and scale of the forms. Viewers also were led to experience qualities of <i>weight, height, gravity, agility</i> or even the <i>appearance of light</i> as a material presence. They were often faced with artworks that demanded <b>a physical as well as a visual response</b>.</p>
            <p>Minimalists sought to breakdown traditional notions of sculpture and to <b>erase distinctions between painting and sculpture</b>. In particular, they rejected the formalist dogma espoused by the critic Clement Greenberg that placed limitations on the art of painting and privileged artists who seemed to paint under his direction. The Minimalists' more democratic point of view was set out in writings as well as exhibitions by their leaders <b>Sol LeWitt</b>, <b>Donald Judd</b>, and <b>Robert Morris</b>.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the reticence and insularity of art influenced by <b>Minimalism</b> and <b>Conceptualism</b> in the 1970s, much art of the 1980s assumed the form of <b>public address</b> — from <b>Jenny Holzer</b>’s use of the Times Square news ticker to broadcast elliptical and vaguely threatening strings of text, to <b>Krzysztof Wodiczko</b>’s night-time projections of symbolically charged imagery onto the facades of museums, public buildings, and corporate headquarters. The infamous <b>""culture wars""</b> that raged at the end of the decade — pitting conservative politicians such as Jesse Helms against artists such as Andres Serrano and organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts — reflected this increased visibility and the socially directed nature of its subject matter: <b>sexuality and identity, repression and power, commodities and desire</b>.</p>

            <p> There was also fluid and fertile interplay between the worlds of art, music, film, and performance seen at venues such as <b>the Mudd Club</b> and <b>the Kitchen in New York</b>. <b>Nan Goldin</b>’s photographs of the early 1980s summarize the underlying ethos of the period: <b>the schizophrenic alternation between a cool detachment and an aggressively confessional style</b>, an exuberant do-it-yourself attitude that masked formal dexterity with the enthusiasm of the amateur, and the recognition that <b>the way one lives life is an inherently political act</b>.</p>
            <p> The scale and ambition of photographically based works also increased in the 1980s in recognition of the medium’s inextricable ties to mass culture in advertising and entertainment. <b>Jeff Wall</b> made his highly staged pictures to be shown as light-filled transparencies of the kind seen in airport terminals and bus stops; he composed his images with <b>all the obsessive detail</b> and <b>narrative suggestion</b> of a film director on location, while also referring to the socially oriented canvases of nineteenth-century French masters such as <b>Courbet</b> and <b>Manet</b>. Wall’s work straddled the worlds of the museum and the street, and was enormously influential later in the decade, especially for the work of <b>Thomas Ruff</b> and the German photographers of the <b>Düsseldorf School</b>. Other artists, including <b>John Baldessari</b> and <b>Christian Boltanski</b>, appropriated banal vernacular photographs — from movie stills to family snapshots, respectively — and integrated them into larger arrangements that commented on the erasure of cultural memory.</p>

            <p>During this period a generation of prominent photographers, many of them American, helped <b>break down</b> these <b>barriers between photography and ""art.""</b> American <b>Robert Mapplethorpe</b> received a maelstrom of attention for his masterfully executed photographs, which ranged from still lifes to portraits to, most controversially, sadomasochistic and homoerotic themes. American photographer <b>Cindy Sherman</b> became an international art star for her elaborately staged self-portraits in which she posed in a variety of stereotypical feminine roles and, in so doing, critiqued these clichés. <b>Barbara Kruger</b>, also American, gained prominence for her modern-day montages, in which she juxtaposed photographic images with text containing social critique—perhaps most famously, the phrases <b>""I Shop, Therefore I Am""</b> and <b>""Your Body Is a Battleground.""</b> A similar use of photography in mixed-media was pursued by American <b>Carrie Mae Weems</b>, who reproduced 19th-century photographs of slaves on a series of banners and scrims, presenting them in a three-dimensional arrangement that commented on the visual representation of African Americans throughout history. </p>

<p> <b>Fashion photographers</b> found their role redefined at the end of the century. As giants of fashion photography from earlier in the century such as <b>Irving Penn</b> and <b>Richard Avedon</b> became the subjects of major museum retrospectives, fashion and celebrity photography, initially meant to illustrate fashion magazines such as <b>Harper’s Bazaar</b> and <b>Vogue</b>, became fully recognized as an art form. Photographers <i>David LaChapelle, Annie Leibovitz, Helmut Newton, Mario Testino, and Bruce Weber</i> were among those whose work was esteemed enough to be exhibited in both gallery and museum shows and published in popular monographs. </p>
            <p>While some of the most creative fashion photography of the 1980s continued to be produced by 'old-timers' like Avedon - see, for instance, his narrative advertising campaign ""The Diors"", or his nude shot of Nastassja Kinski entwined with a snake - younger photographers also emerged into the limelight, including: <b>Herb Ritts</b>, best-known for his iconic shot of ""Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood, 1989"" which appeared in Rolling Stone Magazine; <b>Bruce Weber</b> who presented a new outlook on masculinity through his photo-shoots for Armani and Calvin Klein; <b>Gian Paolo Barbieri</b>, noted for his work for fashion designers Armani, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Pomellato, and Giuseppe Zanotti. At the same time, women's independence was emphasized in various settings, by photographers like <b>Denis Piel</b> and <b>Bert Stern</b>.</p>

            <p>Many artists have practiced and revived aspects of the original <b>Expressionism</b> movement its peak at the beginning of the twentieth century, but the most famous return to Expressionism was inaugurated by <b>Georg Baselitz</b>, who led a revival that dominated German art <b>in the 1970s</b>. By the <b>1980s</b>, this resurgence had become part of an international <b>return to the sensuousness of painting</b> - and away from the stylistically cool, distant sparseness of <b>Minimalism</b> and <b>Conceptualism</b>. Very different artists, especially in the United States, from <b>Julian Schnabel</b> and <b>Francesco Clemente</b> to <b>Jean-Michel Basquiat</b>, turned in expressive directions to create work that <b>affirmed the redemptive power of art</b> in general and painting in particular, drawing upon a variety of themes including the mythological, the cultural, the historical, the nationalist, and the erotic.</p>
            <figure class=""align-left"">

            <p> <b>The Neo-Expressionist artists</b> depicted their subjects in an almost <b>raw and brutish manner</b>, newly resurrecting in their frequently large-scale works, the <b>highly textural and expressive brushwork</b> and <b>intense colors</b> that had been rejected by the immediately preceding art movements.</p>
<p>Since the advent of Abstract Expressionism, painting had become increasingly <b>less focused on subject matter</b> and <b>more concerned with form</b>. <b>Pop art</b> had re-introduced a concern with subject matter of a particular kind, but <b>Neo-Expressionism</b> inaugurated <b>a return to romantic subjects</b>. Some drew on myth and history, while others on primitivism and natural imagery. The first use of the term Neo-Expressionism is undocumented; however, by 1982 it was being widely used to describe new German and Italian art, also happening to be a testament to the end of United States domination of the postwar art world.</p>

            <p><b>By the early 1980s</b>, American artists entered the Neo-Expressionist arena. The artists usually associated with American Neo-Expressionism are the group of New York-based artists that includes <b>Eric Fischl</b>, who emphasized human psychology, and <b>Julian Schnabel</b>, who summoned historical imagery to create highly personal works. Sometimes associated with Neo-Expressionism was the arrival of <b>graffiti art</b> in the galleries. This was particularly significant in New York, where <b>Jean-Michel Basquiat</b> became known for his <b>aggressive brush strokes, broad splatters of paint and emotionally-charged subject matter</b>. In many respects, Basquiat - alongside Julian Schnabel - became the poster child for the Neo-Expressionist movement of the 1980s: <b>a self-styled primitive who was eagerly welcomed by the decadent and upscale art world</b>. The 1980s was a time of great affluence and unabashed consumerism, when the New York art market grew exponentially and the selling prices for contemporary art reached seemingly absurd heights. Rather than reject this environment of commodification, or isolate themselves from the art world, as had many Abstract Expressionists, Basquiat and Schnabel embraced the glitter and the noise fully.</p>

            <p> <b>Decline of Neo-Expressionism</b> was a result of the <b>movement's over-production</b> and the collapse of the market <b>at the end of the 1980s</b>. Artists, critics, and the art market - all intent on making money and/or reputations - conspired to hasten its end. Scholars have not yet sorted out the exact placement of Neo-Expressionism in the art historical narrative. Some see the movement as a kind of late manifestation of modernism, while others see it as the end of modernism. Theorists Arthur Danto and Frederic Jameson place it within the context of postmodernism with its <b>self-aware, surface-oriented banality and use of pastiche</b>. And there are others who emphasize Neo-Expressionism's role in <b>the transition from modernism to postmodernism</b>, pointing to the two major artists whose work persisted through the collapse of the 1980s art bubble: <b>Sigmar Polke</b> and <b>Gerhard Richter</b>. Both were able to simultaneously sustain multiple styles, including the traditional application of paint, even if in tongue-in-cheek and thus more conceptually based manner. In any case, enthusiasm for Neo-Expressionism was being steadily subsumed by emerging discussions of, for example, the need for the inclusion of more female artists as well as new directions in <b>appropriation</b>.</p>

            <p>It was a nervous time for film photography when <b>digital cameras took off in the 1990s</b>, and seemed set to take over entirely. However, <b>in 1991</b>, <b>a group of Austrian art students</b> on a trip to nearby Prague <b>found</b>, in a photographic shop, <b>a curious little camera</b>. Black, compact and heavy, the camera was rudimentary. The lens was protected by a sliding cover. Loading, focusing and rewinding were all done by hand. After developing the shots, the students found it produced pictures unlike anything they had seen before. <b>The colours</b> were <b>rich and saturated</b>, an effect heightened by the lens's tendency to darken the corners of the frame to create a tunnel-like <b>vignetting effect</b>, and there were <b>dramatic contrasts between light and dark</b>. The Austrians were hooked, and so were their friends when they showed them the results back home in Vienna. The little camera was the <b>Lomo LC-A - Lomo Kompact Automat</b>, built in Soviet-era Leningrad by Leningrad Optics and Mechanics Association (Lomo) - and very soon a craze was born. It was <b>an analogue Instagram in the days before digital photography</b>.</p>
            <figure class=""align-left"">

            <p>This Lomo craze may have ended up helping save film photography from an untimely end. <b>In 1992</b>, the students set up <b>Lomographic Society International</b>, exhibiting shots taken on unwanted Lomos they had bought up from all over Eastern Europe. Then, <b>in the mid-90s</b>, having exhausted the supply of left-over Lomos gathering dust in Budapest, Bucharest or East Berlin, they went to the camera's manufacturers - still making optics in St Petersburg - and persuaded them to <b>restart production</b>.</p>

            <figcaption>Lomography photo #2</figcaption></figure>
            <p>The movement's art-school ethos is enshrined in <b>10 golden rules of Lomography</b>, with an emphasis on <b>spontaneity and experimentation</b> - and a rejection of some of photography's basic laws of composition and focusing. It's common for Lomographers to <b>""cross-process"" slide film in negative chemicals</b>, which gives <b>an additional boost to colours and contrast</b>, and to play around with colour filters.</p>
            <p>The original LC-A has been joined by a range of other cameras, some of which are redesigns of the LC-A, but there are also various models of <b>plastic-lensed ""toy"" cameras</b>, <b>the Sprocket Rocket</b>, which exposes the film around the winding sprockets, and <b>the Spinner</b>, which revolves as it shoots, taking a 360-degree picture. The most recent addition is a retro medium-format bellows camera, <b>the Belair</b>.</p>
<p>Photographer <b>Toby Mason</b> from Brighton in the UK, says <b>the foibles of Lomography</b> - the things that conventional photographers might regard as its aberrations - are <b>what make it attractive</b>. Photography all too often becomes a sterile, technical pursuit, in his view. ""When all around us other people are looking for an instant fix, instant results, and images that you just take, look at and delete in a flash, then Lomography is doing something great by <b>going against the grain</b>,"" says Mason. There is also one kind of excitement that most digital photographers have forgotten, or will never experience - the wait for the film to come back from the lab.</p>
            <p><b>Distinguishing features:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Vignettes</b> - the Lomo's shots show a characteristic vignette at the edges, like tunnel vision;</li>
                <li><b>Bold colours</b> - a Lomo hallmark, especially with cross-processed slide film;</li>
                <li><b>Long shutter speed</b> - the Lomo LC-A's shutter stays open for as long as it needs to expose a photo, which can lead to interesting light trails;</li>
                <li><b>Expired film</b> - the LC-A's lens suits the warped coloured shifts found on cheap, expired film;</li>
                <li><b>Small size</b> - the best camera is the one you have with you, and the LC-A fits in a jacket pocket.</li>

            <p>The art movement <b>Abstraction lyrique</b> was born in Paris after the war. At that time, the artistic life in Paris, which had been devastated by the Occupation and Collaboration, resumed with numerous artists exhibited again as soon as the Liberation of Paris in mid-1944. According to the new abstraction forms that characterised some artists, the movement was named by the art critic, <b>Jean José Marchand</b>, and the painter, <b>Georges Mathieu</b>, <b>in 1947</b>. Some art critics also looked at this movement as an attempt to <b>restore the image of artistic Paris</b>, which had held the rank of capital of the arts until the war. <b>Lyrical abstraction</b> also represented <b>a competition between the School of Paris</b> and <b>the new New York School of Abstract Expressionism</b> painting represented above all since 1946 by <b>Jackson Pollock</b>, then <b>Willem de Kooning</b> or <b>Mark Rothko</b>, which were also promoted by the American authorities from the <b>early 1950s</b>.</p>

            <p>Lyrical abstraction was opposed not only to the <b>Cubist</b> and <b>Surrealist</b> movements that preceded it, but also to geometric abstraction (or ""cold abstraction""). Lyrical abstraction was, in some ways, the first to apply the lessons of <b>Kandinsky</b>, considered one of the fathers of abstraction. For the artists, lyrical abstraction represented <b>an opening to personal expression</b>.</p>
            <p>Lyrical Abstraction arose <b>in the 1960s and 70s</b>, following the challenge of <b>Minimalism</b> and <b>Conceptual art</b>. Many artists began moving away from geometric, hard-edge, and minimal styles, toward <b>more lyrical, sensuous, romantic abstractions</b> worked in a loose gestural style. These ""lyrical abstractionists"" sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting, and to revive and reinvigorate a painterly ""tradition"" in American art. At the same time, these artists sought to <b>reinstate the primacy of line and color as formal elements</b> in works composed according to aesthetic principles – rather than as the visual representation of sociopolitical realities or philosophical theories. Characterized by <i>intuitive and loose paint handling, spontaneous expression, illusionist space, acrylic staining, process, occasional imagery</i>, and other painterly techniques, the abstract works included in this exhibition sing with <b>rich fluid color</b> and <b>quiet energy</b>. During <b>the 1990s</b>, lyrical abstraction actively uses <b>complex shaped-canvas structures</b> and <b>illusionary pictorial space</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Street art</b> in general is an important counterculture movement that can be found all over the world. In contrast to <b>graffiti</b> the focus within street art lies more on <b>the artistic approach of the maker</b>. The line between graffiti and street art is not always clear. Within graffiti there has been originally a major focus on the writing of a name, commonly known as a <b>'tag'</b>.</p>
            <p>Some of the earliest expressions of street art were certainly the graffiti which started showing up on the sides of train cars and walls. This was the work of gangs <b>in the 1920s and 1930s New York</b>. The impact of this subversive culture was extraordinarily felt <b>in the 1970s and 1980s</b>. This cultural movement was recorded in the book <b>The History of American Graffiti</b>, by Roger Gastman and Caleb Neelon. These decades were a significant turning point in the history of street art – it was a time when young people, by responding to their socio-political environment, started creating a movement, taking the <b>'battle for meaning'</b> into their own hands.</p>
            <p>Soon, this subcultural phenomenon gained the attention and respect in the 'grown-up' world. From the fingers and cans of teenagers, it had taken a form of true artistic expression. In the defining the movement of street art, we might be looking at the concept itself. Just like graffiti, <b>street art started to appear on the streets</b>. It was – and still is for a big part – <b>an illegal act of art</b>. In graffiti the writers and artist are self-taught, or taught by peers. Within street art we see both self-taught artists, or artists with a background in art school who turned to street art. Because the art is in the streets and public spaces, it is <b>open for everybody</b>. As the XPO magazine nicely expresses about the street art of <b>Banksy</b>: ""There is no language or cultural barrier for the viewer, no university degree in art history required or complicated theory to understand the work. <b>Bam, it grabs you just like that!</b>""</p>

            <p>Not since the advent of the camera has something come along to change the very fabric of art making's possibilities on such a grand scale as <b>digital art</b>. In its most distilled essence, digital art encapsulates an artistic work or practice that uses <b>any form of digital technology</b> as part of its creation or presentation process. As the <b>digital age</b> (also known as the <b>information age</b>) marked its march into the world between <b>1950 and 1970</b>, it was only a matter of time before artists would grasp its progressive technologies for their own creative output. As with all new mediums, artists began to wield these brave new innovations of society, including <b>television</b>, the introduction of the <b>personal computer</b>, the accessibility of <b>audio and visual software</b>, and eventually the <b>internet</b>, into works of their own, with minds ever eager for the expansive opportunities to utilize contemporary means to evolve their voices anew. Although digital art is not recognized as a distinct movement in and of itself, as technology continues its jackrabbit fast bloom into contemporary society, we will no doubt continue to see it unfold into <b>a myriad, ever-changing landscape</b>, solidifying itself as a credible alternative to traditional means of art making for a post-millennial society.</p>
            <p>At its inception, digital art marked <b>a relationship between artists and engineers/scientists</b>, which explored the <b>connections between art and technology</b>. As artists began to explore these technologies, they were not merely using the new medium but were oftentimes also asking viewers to reflect upon the impact of the information age on society overall.</p>

            <p>Digital art greatly <b>expanded the artist's toolbox</b> from the traditional raw materials into the progressive new realm of electronic technologies. Instead of brush and acrylic, artists could now paint with <i>light, sound, and pixels</i>. Instead of paper, artists could collage with found <b>digital imagery</b> or <b>computer-generated graphics</b>. Instead of physical, two-dimensional canvas, artists could concoct <b>three-dimensional graphic works</b> for projection on screen or via multimedia projection.</p>
            <p>Digital art revolutionized the way art could be made, distributed, and viewed. Although some digital art leans heavily on the traditional gallery or museum venue for viewing, especially in the case of installations that require machinery and complex components, much of <b>it can be easily transported and seen via the television, computer screen, social media, or internet</b>. This has empowered artists to create their own careers without the necessity of representation, utilizing contemporary tools like crowdsourcing to fund their work, and the potential to <b>go viral to spread their art into the mainstream consciousness</b>.</p>

            <p>The transformation of photography from an analog medium relying on chemically developed light-sensitive emulsions to one using digital technologies for image capture and storage began <b>in the late 1980s</b> with the introduction of the <b>first consumer digital cameras</b> and <b>in 1990</b> the first version of <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>, a program for adjusting and manipulating digital image files. Conceived as an extension of the conventional darkroom, the program adopted many of the traditional tools of black-and-white film photography but let photographers go even further. By giving photographers <b>the ability to easily change the structure of an image, and even its contents</b>, it called into question long-held assumptions about <b>photographic veracity</b> or <b>documentary ""truth value.""</b> To some minds, it changed the very nature of the medium.</p>
            <p><b>Digital photography’s full impact was not felt until the first decade of the new century</b>. Even as late as 2001, news events — most significantly, <b>the September 11 terrorist attacks</b> in New York City and Washington, D.C. — were photographed primarily with film cameras. But because digital images could be transmitted and edited much more quickly, <b>by decade’s end nearly all newspapers and magazines had transitioned to a digital workflow process</b>, and their photographers were using digital cameras designed for professionals.

            <p>Whereas photojournalists and documentarians reacted with caution to what came to be called digital imaging, other types of photographers were generally enthusiastic about its possibilities. Many artists using photography as their medium developed creative approaches that took advantage of the <b>seamless mutability of digitally altered images</b>, extending a long history of <i>photographic collage</i>, <i>double printing</i>, and other pre-digital forms of manipulation. Digital alteration also influenced the spheres of <b>fashion</b> and <b>celebrity</b>, as photographers such as <b>Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin</b> remade the looks of models and movie stars. Magazines began to regularly send their cover photographs to <b>digital retouchers</b> to eliminate blemishes and minimize their models’ waistlines.</p>
            <p>Arguably the most-profound impact of digital photography has been <b>the proliferation of picture taking and picture sharing</b>. Since <b>2007</b>, the year <b>Apple</b> introduced its first <b>iPhone</b>, so-called <b>smartphones</b> have become ubiquitous, as have picture-sharing applications like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram that enable users to upload pictures from phone to Internet in a matter of seconds. One result has been <b>an almost unfathomable archive of images of mundane events and everyday places</b>, a virtual map of the world that finds its commercial equivalent in Google Earth, which incorporates both satellite views and Google Street View, an assemblage of ground-level pictures of human habitation.</p>

            <p> Photographers have reacted to digital photography’s omnipresence in a variety of ways. Some — such as <b>Chuck Close</b>, <b>Sally Mann</b>, <b>Deborah Luster</b>, and <b>Jerry Spagnoli</b> — have journeyed back to photographic processes of the 19th century, making <b>daguerreotypes</b> or working with <b>wet-collodion plates</b>, or — like <b>Chris McCaw</b> and <b>Alison Rossiter</b> — have taken to printing on <b>outdated enlarging paper</b> from the mid-20th century. <b>Photographic books</b>, predicted to be made obsolete by readily viewable online images, <b>have experienced a resurgent popularity</b>, not only because digital printing has reduced the cost of publication but also because books allow photographers to control the narrative sequence and context in which their images are seen.</p>
            <p>Others have seized an opportunity to <b>critically reflect on the new image environment in which they live</b>. <b>Trevor Paglen</b>, for example, has photographed the light trails of spy satellites as they cross the night sky. In addition, the convergence of still digital photographs and moving video images and the popularity of Web design tools that allow for animation, motion control, and audio editing have produced a creative arena in which photography is but one tool in the production of multimedia experiences. <b>In the 21st century, photography has been absorbed into both the contemporary art world and that of online digital communication</b>, blurring its formerly distinct identity but vastly enhancing its importance as a visual medium.</p>

            <figcaption>'Dave Hill' Effect</figcaption></figure>
            <p><b>High dynamic range (HDR)</b> photographic imaging has been extremely popular in recent years.  It is a style of photography that is frequently employed not only by commercial artists but amateurs too. This was made possible by the widespread ownership of both digital cameras and post-production software like <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>. HDR imaging involves using software to <b>mesh three or more images taken at different exposures</b> (ie one underexposed, one overexposed and one normal) <b>into a single image</b>. Creating something that could be described as <b>a more 'dynamic' image</b>.  To better understand what the photographic results can be, try looking at the work of one of the most talented and successful photographers of this technique – <b>Dave Hill</b> – who uses a combination of <b>HDR</b> and <b>photo illustration</b> (the post-production, Photoshop part) in his work. This relatively young man seems to have HDR-ed every major celebrity around, yet Hill himself suggested a while back that he had had enough; proclaiming more interest in 'natural light' shooting than the artificially lit ones he is most known for.  But <b>because of the quality of Hill’s work, their huge visual impact and distinctive feel, HDR enthusiasts will continue to discuss how to obtain the 'Dave Hill effect'</b>. This, however, is not easy as his images are a result of not only his ability, but hours of work in the photographic and post-production stages. While the most effective HDR image processing is carried out on multiple exposures, it is possible to attempt something similar using a RAW file and layers in Photoshop.</p>

            <p><b>Stuckism</b> is a radical art movement founded in London <b>in 1999</b> to advance new figurative painting with ideas as the most vital artistic means of addressing contemporary issues. Stuckism is a rebuttal of the twentieth century development of <b>Modernism</b>, which has resulted in an increasingly fragmented, isolated, material-obsessed and stultifying academia, existing not by virtue of the work but institutional and financial power, flattered by critical acquiescence. Stuckism regards the foundation of Modernism in art as <b>an opportunity for vision, integrity and communication which has never been fulfilled</b>. </p>
<p>The Stuckists are, therefore, opposed to the current pretensions of so-called Brit Art, Performance Art, Installation Art, Video Art, Conceptual Art, Minimal Art, Body Art, Digital Art and anything claiming to be art which incorporates dead animals or beds - mainly because they are unremarkable and boring. <b>The name Stuckism was derived, in the best art historical tradition, from an insult</b>, in this case from 1999 Turner Prize Nominee, Tracey Emin, to ex-boyfriend, Billy Childish: ""Your paintings are stuck, you are stuck! Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!"" This was quoted in a poem by Billy Childish. Charles Thomson subsequently coined the term Stuckism and proposed joining forces to found a group. <b>The most important ideas behind this impetus are contained in a co-written manifesto, The Stuckists</b>. </p>

<p>This was followed by a manifesto <b>Remodernism</b> <i>'towards a new spirituality in art'</i>, inaugurating a period in art, culture and society to replace the current futility of Postmodernism. Remodernism provides a framework to include those working in disciplines other than painting (and even outside the arts altogether), who subscribe to the same values as the Stuckists. <b>The Defastenist art group</b> in Ireland have declared themselves a Remodernist group. Ten other artists were invited to exhibit as the Stuckist group (Sanchia Lewis joined during the first show). The core members of the group have been in creative collaboration through art, poetry and music over the last twenty-five years, initially in a group called <b>The Medway Poets</b>.</p>
<p>Stuckist artists are not required or expected to subscribe wholesale to any ideas in manifestos, nor even necessarily to agree with each others work. <b>What they have in common is the recognition of an underlying ethos</b>. The connection between the work can only be appreciated behind the stylistic diversity in <b>the primary importance of truth to self and experience, emotional engagement, meaning, content and communication</b>.</p>
<p>Since the foundation of Stuckism there has been support from round the world and there are now <b>over 170 groups</b> in <b>41 countries</b>. They are all independent and self-directed but allied through the Stuckism International network. The Melbourne Stuckists were the first group outside the UK. The founding artists of Stuckism include <b>Philip Absolon</b>, <b>Frances Castle</b>, and <b>Eamon Everall</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Contemporary art</b> is the art of today, produced in <b>the late 20th century</b> or in <b>the 21st century</b>. Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that challenge traditional boundaries and defy easy definition. <b>Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or 'ism.'</b> Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.</p>
            <p>A term <b>'Contemporary Impressionism'</b> is used to describe works created by contemporary artists that share similar aesthetic qualities with those by the <b>French Impressionists</b>. Whether depicting urban environments or the natural world, all of the images that can be considered Contemporary Impressionist are rendered with <b>loose, expressive brushwork</b> and <b>focus on the effects of light</b>. Like many of the Impressionists, <b>Nancy Friese</b> painted her watercolor <i>Walk to the Sea (2012)</i> outdoors, or en plein air, in order to better capture the effects of changing light and weather on the landscape. With its emphasis on the effects of fading daylight and the illumination from the stores and streetlights, the downtown Boston marketplace in <b>John Terelak</b>’s painting, <i>Faneuil Hall</i>, could easily be mistaken for 1880s Paris.</p>

            <p><b>Leonid Afremov</b> is one of the contemporary impressionistic artists. The classic Impressionist painters used <b>large blogs of paints</b> to fill in their scenes, <b>hinting at shapes and stories without describing every tiny detail</b>. They let the viewer’s mind fill in the scene. Leonid’s paintings have the same effect. Looking at his paintings, it’s easy to drift down a suddenly recalled memory or to have an emotion evoked. His paintings seem to slow down time and capture a moment, letting the viewer luxuriate in the scene. The painter is famous for his unusual, yet very effective technique: all he uses for his paintings are <b>oils, canvas and the palette-knife</b>.  ""My artwork is the result of a long painting process; every canvas is born during the creative search; every painting is full of my inner world. Each of my paintings brings <b>different moods, colors and emotions</b>. I love to express the beauty, harmony and spirit of this world in my paintings."" – Leonid Afremov. </p>
